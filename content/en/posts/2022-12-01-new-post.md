I had been resistant to building a website by myself. It may result from my working experience that I was the one who planned and layout the websites asking the product manager, developer, and designer to deploy and set them. I used to think programming was a waste of time compared with thinking of new ideas and optimizing my copywriting (clearly, I prefer copywriting to designing or programming). 

However, now, I am building my website. A new gate is open to me.
Since no one is born with success, do not set limits for yourself. If you set limits to try and change, you also set limits to success.
